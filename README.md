# Replaying DogLog logs in AdvantageKit

## About

I just wanted to see if I could take Doglog logs, and replay them in AdvantageKit. 

Turns out you can!

## Brief Overview 

In the [main](https://github.com/boomermath/doglogreplay/blob/main/src/main/java/frc/robot/Main.java)
class of this project, you will find a flag to set replay true or false, which will run a 
different robot based on whether or not the user wants to replay the logs
